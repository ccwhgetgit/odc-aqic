## Ocean Data Challenge :: Air Quality in Catalonia
https://desights.ai/challenge/2/0 

### Summary
--- 
Examining open data on particulate matter can help improve our understanding of air pollution and inform strategies to reduce it. Data scientists can help researchers and policymakers make informed decisions about mitigating its effects by providing comprehensive analytics and predictive algorithms.

### Description 
---
Through this challenge we aim to analyze the evolution of air pollutants in Catalonia over the past three decades and develop algorithms to predict air pollutant concentrations. You are asked to perform three tasks:
* Make a global analysis of the air quality in Catalonia.
Build algorithms to predict the concentration of pollutants in the air using Ocean Protocol's Compute-to-Data technology.
* Write a final report presenting your approach, results, conclusions and recommendations.

Data is provided via the Catalan Transparency Portal by the General Directorate of Transparency and Good Governance of the Generalitat de Catalunya. The portal provides data on Catalonia's transparency and good governance, in addition to details on public administration, citizen participation, and information access. The dataset contains hourly measurements of air pollution from 1991 to the present, collected by the automatic measuring stations of the Air Pollution Monitoring and Forecasting Network.
